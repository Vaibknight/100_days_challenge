#Explanation


- create one counter method and make this method synchronize and then call this method from different threads five times.


Explanation:

While we use synchronize a method and call this method from a different thread then still it executes this thread in a synchronous way.

In this program, I created one class synchronized thread which has one synchronized counter method in this method simply increment the I by one. Also, I create two other class thread 1 and thread 2 in this both class I implements the run method and in this run method, I simply call the counter method five-time.


Test Cases:

1.  n = 10;
2. If user enter negative number

Example
Output: 1
2
3
4
5
1
2
3
4
5
