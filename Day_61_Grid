#Explanation


-A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down




Example

Input -

n = 3, m = 3

Output -

6

package vaibhav;

public class Backtrack_grid {
	
	public static int grid(int i, int j, int n, int m) {
		
		if(i == n-1 && j == m-1) {
			return 1;
		}
		else if(i == n || j == n) {
			return 0;
		}
		
		
		int w1 = grid(i+1,j,n,m); // For downwards
		int w2 = grid(i,j+1,n,m); // For rightwards
		return w1 + w2;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int n = 3, m = 3;
		System.out.println(grid(0,0,n,m));
	}
