#Explanation


- Given an array, , of  real number strings, sort them in descending order â€” but wait, there's more! Each number must be printed in the exact same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that  is printed as , and  is printed as . If two numbers represent numerically equivalent values (e.g., ), then they must be listed in the same order as they were received as input).




Example

Input -

9
-100
50
0
56.6
90
0.12
.12
02.34
000.000

Output -

90
56.6
50
02.34
0.12
.12
0
000.000
-100
